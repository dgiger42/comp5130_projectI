        <p><strong>Rubik's Cube Solver V1:</strong> (written in C++, finds inefficient solutions quickly)</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cube Solver V2:</strong> (written in Rust, finds optimal solutions, 
            requires more time & uses more advanced data structures such as multi-layer 
            Bloom filters designed to be safely modified in parallel using atomic operations.  Finding 
            <em>optimal</em> solutions is <em>much</em> more computationally intensive than finding inefficient solutions)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Cube Solver V3</strong> (complete rewrite in Python, uses a neural network + beam search to 
            find near-optimal solutions faster than the V2 version)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prime Sieve Project:</strong> (not cube themed for a change).  A highly optimized hybrid 
            approach for finding prime numbers up to N.  Combines two prime number generation techniques
            to achieve O(n) time while avoiding the poor constant factors typically
            associated with O(n) prime number generation techniques.  Often outperforms 
            <a href="https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve" >primesieve</a> 
            (which is reputed to be the fastest prime number generation program) 
            in single-threaded prime number generation, at least on the two machines I've 
            tested it on.  (I haven't made the repo public yet.)
